Assumptions
Font Availability: The JSON file assumes that all specified font weights and styles exist for the listed font families. If a specified weight or style is not available, the script tries to find the closest match.

Improvements
If given more time, the following improvements could be made:

Error Handling: Enhance error handling for font loading failures, such as invalid URLs or network issues.
User Feedback: Provide visual feedback when fonts or styles are not available, such as showing a warning message.
Responsive Design: Improve the CSS to make the editor and controls responsive and more user-friendly on mobile devices.
Performance Optimization: Optimize the loading and switching of fonts to improve performance, possibly by preloading fonts.
Font Preview: Add a font preview feature to allow users to see how their text will look with the selected font and weight before applying it.
Accessibility: Improve accessibility features to ensure that the editor is usable by all users, including those with disabilities.
